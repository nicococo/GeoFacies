<p>This software combines the code for learning with latent dependency structures based
on conditional random fields. 
Software code was written by Nico Goernitz in close collaboratoration
with Luiz A. Lima, and Shinichi Nakaijma. TU Berlin, 2015.</p>

<p>Analyzing data with unknown spatial and/or temporal structure is a challenge for machine learning. We propose a novel nonlinear model for studying data with latent dependency structure. It successfully combines the concepts of Markov random fields, transductive learning and regression, heavily using the notion of joint feature maps. Our transductive conditional random field regression (TCRFR) model is able to infer latent structure by combining limited labeled data of high precision with unlabeled data containing measurement uncertainty. In this manner we can propagate certain information and greatly reduce uncertainty. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel framework on toy data with known spatio-temporal structure and successfully validate on real world off-shore data from the oil industry. Here the generic challenge is to optimally integrate data resources such as oil well data containing highly accurate direct measurements of rock porosities, geologically hand-crafted data, and impedances with broad and imprecise data from spatial hydrophone array measurements.</p>
